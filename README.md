# RameFrame: Your Go-To for Cool, Customizable Frames

## What's RameFrame?

Imagine a frame system that's as flexible as you need it to be. Whether you're whipping up a quick gift or jazzing up your space, RameFrame lets you create picture frames in any size and style you want.

## Build it Your Way

Start with a base plate—pick any size that fits your spot. Snap in some cool add-ons like a desk stand or a wall mount. Want something unique? Go wild and design your own add-ons to match your style or theme (like a holder for your honeycomb wall).

## Snap and Swap Covers

The best part? Changing looks is a breeze. Design your own cover or pick from the community’s creations. Every cover fits every frame size, thanks to RameFrame’s specification. Mix, match, and swap anytime to keep your space fresh and exciting.

## Why RameFrame?

It’s all about making framing easy, fast, and fun. Build, customize, and change up your frames in a snap with RameFrame! Perfect for gifts, home décor, or just because you feel like it. Let your creativity run wild with RameFrame.
